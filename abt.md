## BIO

Jinn was born and raised in East Vancouver to Hong Kong and Vietnamese immigrants. He lives in the suburbs with his wife, three teenage monsters, and a Chihuahua-Beagle rescue from Mexico. He works at an ad agency.

## NAME

His Chinese name is 鐘藝進. The Cantonese jyutping pronunciation is _zung1 ngai6 zeon3_. On his Canadian birth certificate, the last name, 鐘 (_zung1_), is transliterated to Chung, which is common. 藝進 (_ngai6 zeon3_), however, is spelt Yuet Jinn, which appears to be a botched attempt at the Mandarin pronunciation (yì jìn).

## TOOLS

Jinn writes in longhand with a Pelikan Souverän M809 EF named _Orpheus_. Orpheus bleeds Iroshizuku fuyu-syogun.
